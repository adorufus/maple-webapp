    <p> By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore
        that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the app, any part of the
        app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app, and you
        also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages or make derivative versions. The app itself, and
        all the trademarks, copyright, database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still
        belong to Redwoods Digital. </p>
    <p> Redwoods Digital is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
        we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for any reason.
        We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
        paying for. </p>
    <p> The Maple app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our Service. It’s your
        responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend that you do not jailbreak
        or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the
        official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious
        programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the Maple app won’t work properly or
        at all. </p>

        <p> The app does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions. </p>

    <p> You should be aware that there are certain things that Redwoods Digital will not take responsibility for.
        Certain functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection can be
        Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider, but Redwoods Digital cannot take responsibility for the app
        not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
        allowance left. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p> If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement with
        your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider for the
        cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third-party charges. In using
        the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app
        outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the
        bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received
        permission from the bill payer for using the app. </p>
    <p> Along the same lines, Redwoods Digital cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the app i.e. You
        need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to avail
        the Service, Redwoods Digital cannot accept responsibility. </p>
    <p> With respect to Redwoods Digital’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the app, it’s
        important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times, we do
        rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Redwoods Digital
        accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on this
        functionality of the app. </p>
    <p> At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the
        requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app
        to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the app. Redwoods Digital does
        not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the Android &amp;
        iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept updates to the
        application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any
        time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the
        rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed)
        delete it from your device. </p>
